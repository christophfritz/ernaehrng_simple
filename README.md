# ernaehrng_simple
Simple website for a nutrition consultant (female)

The goal of this project is to create a basic (static) website which should function as a landing page for a female
nutrition consultant. The first version will be written with simple HTML and CSS without the use of flexbox or bootstrap
 to get a better idea and understanding of simple CSS.

The webiste will also be built fully responsible so it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

###Update

The website is now online (christophfritz.github.io/nutrition_website_simple) and I think that there is no need to use
flexbox. There may be minor changes now and then if I spot a bug or anything I can do better but for now the website is
finished and I will start a new project.
