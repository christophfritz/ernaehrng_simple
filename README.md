Simple website for a nutrition consultant (female)

The goal of this project is to create a basic (static) website which should function as a landing page for a female nutrition consultant.
The first version will be written with simple HTML and CSS without the use of flexbox or bootstrap to get a better idea and understanding of simple CSS.

The webiste will be built fully responsible so it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

There will later be an updated version of this with other solutions but for now I am going to try it that way.
